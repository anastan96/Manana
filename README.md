# Microbit
Simple program that implements a working, graphical simulation of a
5x5 LED matrix.
It allows the user to turn the LEDs on or off through some simple, easy to
use graphical interface. Once created, it allows the created animation to be saved in a format
that can be easily “cut and pasted” into a micro:bit program written in the C language.
